## Styling Overview

The application's user interface is styled using the following CSS:

- **Body:**
  - Centers the content on the page with `display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, and `align-items: center`.
  - Sets the background color to a soft beige (`#F7EFE5`).

- **Card:**
  - The main container for the quote and button.
  - Styled with a purple background (`#C8A1E0`), rounded corners (`border-radius: 15px`), and a shadow effect (`box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px #674188`).
  - The card's size is set to be 27% of the viewport width and 300px in height, with some margin at the top.

- **Quote Box:**
  - The area where the generated quote is displayed.
  - Centered within the card, with a background color matching the body, rounded corners, and centered text.
  - The text inside has a font size of `20px` for readability.

- **Button:**
  - Positioned below the quote inside the card.
  - Styled with a dark purple background (`#674188`), light beige text (`#F7EFE5`), and rounded corners.
  - The button is 200px wide and at least 40px high.

This styling ensures that the app has a clean, modern look with a focus on readability and user interaction.

## Future Enhancements

- **Add More Content:** Expand the arrays with more situations, actions, and objects to increase the variety of generated messages.
- **Improved Styling:** Enhance the visual design of the app, possibly adding animations or themes.
- **Save and Share:** Implement a feature to save or share generated messages via social media.
